    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>This is the NameLegoSet website.</p>
    <p>It allows you to search your name and get a personal Lego set.</p>
    <p>Basically, what this thing does is it goes to the Agify API and,
        instead of getting the expected age, gets the "count" field (number of entries in their db, I guess?)
    </p>
    <p>Then it takes that count, manipulates it, and tries to get a Lego set using that count as the ID field.
    </p>
    <p>This Lego set is the personalized set for the user.
    </p>
    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <p>Publicly deployed: see link</p>
    <p>Is responsive: Uses media queries, see main.css</p>
    <p>Uses two different APIs: Uses the Agify API to get the personal id and the Rebrickable API to get the Lego set
        data.</p>
    <p>Displays results: Press the "show details" button after searching to see full results.</p>
    <p>Results are filterable: Well, there's only one result, so there can't be much filtration. However, the results
        are still generally interactable, as you can show and hide details about them.
    </p>
